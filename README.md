## Project 1 - Illumination Corrector Algorithm
### System S.p.A. (*Italy*)

### Objectives

26.  1: Find the equation from a curve that represents the image
27. distortion in a vision-based quality control system.
28.  
29. 2: Test the new calibration method by comparing it with the
30. previous manual method.

### Software

31. Language:	C++
32. Library:	MIL (Matrox Imaging Library)
33. IDE:		Visual Studio
34. OS:		Windows

### Methodology

35. 1: Simulated the previous calibration method using a “Calibration Tile”
36. 
37. 2: Obtained the image distortion equation by applying a
38. quadratic regression to the average profile from several
39. sample tiles.
40.
41. 3: Simulated the new calibration method using the image
42. distortion equation.
43.
44. 4: Calculated the error from both methods applied to
45. several sample tiles and compared them.
46.
47. 5: Deliver an algorithm that applies an illumination correction
48. to the images taken by Qualitron system.

### Sample Images - Sample Profile - Curve and Adjusted Profile

## Project 2 - Hexacopter's Flight Control System

### Objectives

49. 1: Developed a program that recognized pre-defined marks
50. as flight commands under variable light conditions.
51. 
52. 2: Ran the program in a single-board Linux operated computer
53. on an Hexacopter.
54.
55. 3: Communicated the commands to the drone’s flight controller.

### Software

56. Language:	C++
57. Library:	OpenCV
58. Text editor:	Sublime Text
59. OS:		Ubuntu

### Methodology

60. 1: Selected the color space (HSV) to apply a color filter.
61.
62. 2: Compared multiple shape recognition methods and selected
63. the one with the best performance (Hu moments).
64.
65. 3: Developed a marks recognition algorithm.
66.
67. 4: Tested algorithm under different light conditions.
68:
69: 5: Tested program controlling the flight of an AR Parrot.
70:
71: 7: Deliver a final presentation and report of the achievements
72: and conclusions.

### Testing of different features for the program



## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/carlosefabila/carlosefabila.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
