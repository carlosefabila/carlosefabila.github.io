## Project 1 - Illumination Corrector Algorithm
### (*Italy*)
![Picture 01](Picture 01.png)

### Objectives

1: | Find the equation from a curve that represents the image distortion in a vision-based quality control system.
2: | Test the new calibration method by comparing it with the previous manual method.

### Software

Language: | C++
Library: | MIL (Matrox Imaging Library)
IDE: | Visual Studio
OS: | Windows

### Methodology

1: | Simulated the previous calibration method using a “Calibration Tile”
2: | Obtained the image distortion equation by applying a quadratic regression to the average profile from several sample tiles.
3: | Simulated the new calibration method using the image distortion equation.
4: | Calculated the error from both methods applied to several sample tiles and compared them.
5: | Deliver an algorithm that applies an illumination correction to the images taken by Qualitron system.

### Objectives

1: | Developed a program that recognized pre-defined marks as flight commands under variable light conditions.
2: | Ran the program in a single-board Linux operated computer on an Hexacopter.
3: | Communicated the commands to the drone’s flight controller.

### Software

Language: | C++
Library: | OpenCV
Text editor: | Sublime Text
OS: | Ubuntu

### Methodology

1: | Selected the color space (HSV) to apply a color filter.
2: | Compared multiple shape recognition methods and selected the one with the best performance (Hu moments).
3: | Developed a marks recognition algorithm.
4: | Tested algorithm under different light conditions.
5: | Tested program controlling the flight of an AR Parrot.
6: | Deliver a final presentation and report of the achievements and conclusions.
